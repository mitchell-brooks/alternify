# Alternify

## Alternify helps users see all available options for streaming media.

Alternify takes a streaming music link from one platform and provides a user with links to listen to the same song on other platforms.

It's a work in progress for now, but its initial iteration is a browser extension that detects streaming links on a page, queries the alternify service and provides alternatives.

Future versions will include a web app and I have plans for a Twitter bot and potentially a mobile app.

Code is primarily written in TypeScript and the microservices leverage the AWS stack, utilizing the Serverless Stack framework.
